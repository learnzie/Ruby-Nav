            When we refer to “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
            mean any information by which you may be personally identified or
            contacted, whether online or offline. When you use the Service or

            other Personal Information from you as further described in our
            Ruber Software Agreement and/or ruber policies and procedures. As a
            customer user or a ruber, it is always your choice whether or not to
            provide Personal Information. If you choose not to provide requested
            Personal Information, you may not be able to participate in certain
            activities or use certain features of the Service or the App.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Information.</h3>
          <p>
            We may also collect and use technical data and related information,
            such as information about your device, system and application
            software, peripherals and other data related to your interactions
            with the Service (“Technical Information”). We automatically collect
            Technical Information through the use of “cookies” and other similar
            collection technologies, like pixels, web beacons and local storage.
            The information we collect from these technologies may include your
            web settings and preferences, website analytics information, device
            type, phone operating system and push ID. Rubynav does not consider
            this information to be Personal Information. Ruby owns all Technical
            Information and may use it for any lawful purpose. Depending on your
            browser, you may be able to remove and reject cookies from our
            Website or the Service by changing your browser settings. The
            default setting of many browsers is set to accept cookies until you
            change your settings. Please note that if you disable or refuse
            cookies, certain features of the Website or the Service may become
            inaccessible or may not function properly.
          </p>

          <h3>Location Information</h3>
          .
          <p>
            We also collect information about your geographic location from you
            or your device, including your country, region, city, zip code,
            street address, time zone, latitude, longitude, and horizontal
            position representation information (“Location Information”).
          </p>

          <h3>Social Information.</h3>
          <p>
            We may also collect information about you from various third-party
            services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others) through
            their applicable APIs or otherwise (“Social Information”).
          </p>

          <h3>Tracking and Do Not Track Signals.</h3>
          <p>
            We use the Website, the App and the Service to collect information
            about your activities over time and across third-party websites,
            applications or other online services (“Tracking Information”). Your
            web browser, application platform or device may allow you to opt-out
            of our collection of Tracking Information by selecting a “do not
            track” (or similar) setting. However, we do not currently have
            processes to address those settings or other “do not track”
            requests, and consequently, cannot guarantee that we will honor such
            requests. If you do not want us to collect this information, do not
            use the Website, the App or the Service. Order Information and Other
            Information You Voluntarily Disclose. Certain features of Service
            and the App are designed to display Information that you choose to
            provide to other users (such as texts between customer users and the
            runners delivering products), or to other third parties (such as
            merchants from whom you order products). Please keep in mind that
            whenever you voluntarily disclose Information by ordering products
            or otherwise providing such Information through the Service or the
            App (including, for example, if you provide building or security
            codes to a runner), that Information can be seen by those users or
            third parties to whom you send that Information. We are not
            responsible for the security or privacy of any Information you
            choose to submit in connection with these features.
