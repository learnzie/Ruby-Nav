          <p>
            This is how to interpret this Agreement. This Agreement, and the
            documents we reference in this Agreement, is the entire agreement
            between Rubynav and you regarding the Rubynav Service. Our failure
            to exercise or enforce any right will not operate as a waiver of
            such right. Headings and the summaries before each section of this
            Agreement are provided for convenience and to aid in readability
            only. These headings and summaries have no legal or contractual
            effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by
            law. If any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or
            unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from this
            Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any
            remaining provisions. If you have any questions regarding this
            Agreement, Rubynav can be reached at: contact@rubynav.com.
