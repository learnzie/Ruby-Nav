            <h2>Can I have alcohol delivered?</h2>
            <p>
              Rubynav delivers beer and wine from all stores. For the safety of
              both Rubers and customers, all deliveries are now 100%
              contactless. You will scan your ID and submit a selfie in the app
              which will be verified by your Rubers prior to delivery. If you
              are unresponsive, intoxicated, or unable to receive your delivery
              for any reason, your Rubers will return your items and you may be
              charged a restocking fee. In most cities, you can order beer and
              wine from 7am to 11pm Monday through Friday, 7am to 12am on
              Saturday, and 12pm to 11pm on Sunday. However, operation hours
              vary by market.

            <h2>How does Rubynav work?</h1>
            <p>
              Go to Rubynav.com or download the Ruby app to browse popular
              nearby restaurants and Grocery stores, Errands, Gig-Pros or tap
              the ‘search’ icon to order from any store within your delivery
              zone. You can add items from our menus or type in custom orders.
              After you order your Rubynav, it is assigned to one of our Rubers,
              who will complete your delivery. Rubers act as your personal
              assistant that you can text throughout entire delivery, so if you
              decide you need to make any changes, text your Ruber to let them
              know. You can track your delivery and pay directly through
              Rubynav.com or the Ruby app. All payment information is saved
              securely so you only need to enter it once.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>How do I pay for a Ruby?</h2>
            <p>
              Ruby is completely cashless. All payment is made through our app
              and we accept all major credit and debit cards. When you order
              your first Rubynav, you’ll enter your payment information, which
              we store securely. You only need to enter your payment info once.
              After you place a Rubynav, we will perform a pre-authorization on
              your default payment method. Additionally, you will have a short
              time after it’s been completed to proactively pay. During this
              time you can add a promo code, change the suggested Ruber tip, and
              choose which card you’d like to use. After this short time, we
              will automatically charge your default payment method and the
              suggested tip.
